# Amazon.co.jp tracker for Masks
Back then when COVID-19 started, I did not have enough masks and I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a pack of masks sold by unethetical profiteers.

I wrote this little project to scrape Amazon.co.jp for surgical masks that are sold by Amazon directly.

When an item becomes available, it will automatically add the item to cart and proceed to the final checkout confirmation page.

There is no guarantee that the script will still work today because I no longer use it.
